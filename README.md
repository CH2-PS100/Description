# Description

## Background
Our team is developing a handwriting app for early diagnosis of dyslexia in children. We want to equip parents with the tools to identify and address this learning difficulty at its onset. Our team identified a need for early detection tools for dyslexia, particularly in regions like Indonesia where awareness is still growing. 

We recognized that early diagnosis can significantly improve a child’s life trajectory, preventing dyslexia from impacting their adolescence and adulthood. Inspired by this, we decided to develop a handwriting application aimed at detecting dyslexia in children at the kindergarten, preschool, and elementary school levels. 

Our goal is to equip parents with the necessary tools to identify and address this learning difficulty at its onset, fostering an environment where every child can thrive. This project is our step towards creating a more inclusive society.

## Feature 
### 1. Dyslexia Image Scanner
This feature asks the user to scan handwriting to detect whether the person has Dyslexia. The system will output what percentage of users have Dyslexia and also a diagnosis.

### 2. Article
The article feature contains various information which is expected to help and expand user awareness regarding Dyslexia diseases

### 3. History Detection 
This feature functions to display the user's scan history and diagnosis

## Next Feature Release
### 1. Added other disease detection features
Our group plans to add other disease detection to our application such as stunting and others by using input according to needs
### 2. chat feature with doctors.
Our group plans to make the dyslexia scanner app even more helpful to users by adding a chat feature for various diseases detected by our app over time.
### 3. improve accuracy and diagnosis


## Notes 

### Machine Learning
* Find the suitable dataset. 
* Develop and train a dyslexia detection model using TensorFlow.
* Implement TensorFlow Lite for model deployment on resource-constrained environments.
* Explore and integrate TensorFlow.js for model deployment.
* Design and implement a data pipeline for efficient model serving.
* Preprocess the dataset, including missing values imputation for enhanced model performance.
* Evaluate and fine-tune the model's hyperparameters for optimal performance.


### Cloud Computing
* Developing an API to predict Dyslexia
* Creating a service using Firebase
* Create a Database to store prediction results
* Create a DockerFile and  Build Docker Image
* Deploy using Cloud Run

### Mobile Development
* Creating UI design
* Configure android environment
* Developing the application using cotlin
* Create database for article using realtime database from firebase
