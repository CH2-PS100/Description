# Description

## Background
Our team is developing a handwriting app for early diagnosis of dyslexia in children. We want to equip parents with the tools to identify and address this learning difficulty at its onset. Our team identified a need for early detection tools for dyslexia, particularly in regions like Indonesia where awareness is still growing. 

We recognized that early diagnosis can significantly improve a childâ€™s life trajectory, preventing dyslexia from impacting their adolescence and adulthood. Inspired by this, we decided to develop a handwriting application aimed at detecting dyslexia in children at the kindergarten, preschool, and elementary school levels. 

Our goal is to equip parents with the necessary tools to identify and address this learning difficulty at its onset, fostering an environment where every child can thrive. This project is our step towards creating a more inclusive society.
